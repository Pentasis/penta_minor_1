# Consolidated Mods

In this TPF2 mod I combined ideas from various other mods. All code is written from scratch, but textures are (for now) borrowed from other mods.

If there is anyone who is good with textures and icons willing to help me with that? I'm horrible at graphics and would like some sort of consistency in my mods as well as original content so I can publish it without infringing any possible copyrights.

## Features

All features are vanilla-esque. I.e. they either change vanilla behaviour or build upon it.

### Tracks
- Added 2 standard tracks with speed-limits of 40 and 80 km/h.
- Added 3 High-speed tracks with speed-limits of 40, 80 & 160 km/h.
- Added an old, weathered track with a speed-limit of 25 km/h and no catenary when electrified.
- Added categories for tracks.
- Railroad crossings close sooner.
- Trains stop further away from signals.

Any more track-speeds seems overkill or overpowered to me.
(Side note: I wish UG would add programmable signals to the game, so if signal A detects X, do Y.)

### Roads
- Added 3 industrial roads (30, 50 & 60 km/h). They are based on town-streets but have narrow, flat pedestrian sidewalks. Lights on one side only and no AI-building.
- Added 4 rural roads with 25 km/h speed-limit in dirt, grass, gravel and a tree-lined dirt one.
- Added 3 pedestrian-only "roads" in dirt, grass and asphalt.
- Added 2 tram-only roads in concrete and grass.
- Changed how tram tracks look; less shiny with actual groove.
- Changed the maximum slope of roads to be more realistic (no more steep inclines)
- Added categories for roads.

### Cargo & Production
- Increased production of industry by a factor of 4.
- Increased the capacity of all vehicles by a factor of 4.
- Increased capacity of warehouses by factor 4.
- Changed cargo weights to be more realistic.
- Industry now acts as industrial magnets (cims will go to work there).
- Tools now require steel instead of wood and Goods require wood & plastic instead of steel & plastic.

The base game divides all vehicle capacities by 4. The only thing this does afaik is increase the number of vehicles needed to transport everything; demand remains the same.

### Vehicles
- the BAE-146 (passenger & cargo) planes can now land on small airfields.
- The Virgo & Hercules Towboats now have a variant that have 1 normal barge and 1 tanker barge, making them capable of transporting all cargo.
- There is an option to change the maintenance interval.

### Bridges
- Added some (colour) variants to iron and stone bridges.
- Iron bridges no longer have gaps in the wrong place.

### Towns
- An option to decrease/increase town development interval.
- In the Editor tab, you can disable/enable town growth per town (stop development) WARNING: This settings is saved even after mod has been removed.
- Option to make town street-layout grid or no-grid.

### UI
- Better contour-lines.
- Grey cargo icons to differentiate with passenger icons.
- More resizable windows.
- Softer (old) bulldozer sounds.

### Tools
- Bigger brushes
- Extra brushes

### Misc
- Rocks are less white & shiny.
- Game always starts paused.
- Increased render distance.
- Cars & Cims now transition longer between era's (old cars & clothes will be used longer).
- Achievements with mods.
- Industry button.
- Sandbox mode enabled.
- No end year for vehicles.

### TODO:
- Cargo station anachronism fix (cargo_lamps, cargo_pallet_jack, cargo_speakers)?
- More brushes
- Railyard tracks?
- Colour variants to tunnel (same as bridge)?
- Truck station entrance-roads: improve them
- Line designations
- Line statistics?

## Incompatible mods
Not so much incompatible but they provide similar mechanics and are no longer needed when using this mod.

## My other mods
- All Vanilla Assets (AVA); makes all models in the game placeable, including vehicles. Difference with other mods that do this: icons instead of cryptic names. WIP/Soon
- Time of Day. Allows you to choose between morning, noon, dusk & night as well as clear, cloudy and overcast weather. WIP/Soon
- Mountain generator. Terrain generator with higher mountains and wider rivers. WIP/Soon
