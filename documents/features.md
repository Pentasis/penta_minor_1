# Penta Minor

- Better contourlines.
- Achievements with mods enabled
- enable sandbox mode and industry button
- increase render distance
- Increased terraintool brushes and added more brushes
- More realistic maximum slope for streets/roads. I didn’t do this for tracks and I also didn’t change curve speeds on tracks because realism would hinder gameplay in those instances.
- Added tracks with 40, 80 & 160 km/h. More than that would be overkill in my view. (I really wish the game would get special speed-limiting signals that would reduce maximum speed on the track-block after that sign)
- Added a weathered, wooden track with a max speed of 25 km/h
- Added 3 Industrial roads. Look like city roads, but with flat, narrow pedestrian sidewalks, more worn texture and no AI building. 30, 50 & 60 km/h
- Added 3 rural roads (dirt, gravel, grass) 25 km/h
- Added 2 bus/tram tracks (no cars, pedestrians or ai)
- Added 3 pedestrian only paths (dirt, grass, asphalt)
- Added category buttons for roads & tracks
- Changed cargo-weight to be more in line with reality.
- Created overlap in cim appearance & cars between eras.
- Different colour for cargo icons (made them grey).
- Parallel road/track
- Option to set maintenance interval
- Option to stop town-growth
- Tweaked distance for open/close railroad crossings
- Option less grid-street layout
- Always start game paused
