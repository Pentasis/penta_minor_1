Penta Minor

x Better contourlines.
x Achievements with mods enabled
x enable sandbox mode (includes industry button)
x increase render distance
o Increased terraintool brushes and added more brushes
x More realistic maximum slope for streets/roads. I didn’t do this for tracks and I also didn’t change curve speeds on tracks because realism would hinder gameplay in those instance.
x Added tracks with 40, 80 & 160 km/h. More than that would be overkill in my view. (I really wish the game would get special speed-limiting signals that would reduce maximum speed on the track-block after that sign)
o Added a weathered, wooden track with a max speed of 25 km/h
o Added 3 Industrial roads. Look like city roads, but with flat, narrow pedestrian sidewalks, more worn texture and no AI building. 30, 50 & 60 km/h
o Added 3 rural roads (dirt, gravel, grass) 25 km/h
o Added 2 bus/tram tracks (no cars, pedestrians or ai)
o Added category buttons for roads & tracks
x Changed cargo-weight to be more in line with reality.
Created overlap in cim appearance & cars between eras.
o Different colour for cargo icons (made them grey).
Parallel road/track
o Option to set maintenance interval
Option to stop town-growth
x Tweaked distance for open/close railroad crossings
o Option less grid-street layout
x Always start game paused
